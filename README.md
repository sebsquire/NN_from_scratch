# NN_from_scratch
Neural Network implementation from scratch based on: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6
Activation function = sigmoid function
Standard feedforward + backpropagation (sgd)
I added learning rate, momentum and bias.
All weights are initialised randomly.
Problem being solved is simple XOR.

Libraries used: NumPy, MatPlotLib
